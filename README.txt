//Different from the assignment, my RPC accepts ip:port instead of just ip to identify the worker (this is needed because all my workers are running on a single local machine)
//Crawler does not convert localhost to 127.0.0.1. For proper behaviour, all the links and input have to use one or the other. The local workers are referred to using 127.0.0.1:port by the way.

Special instructions for compiling/running the code should be included in this file.

There should be no special instructions for this assignment in this file.

The End.
